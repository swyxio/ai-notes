	- These datasets were used to win the 1st Progress Prize of the AI Math Olympiad and consist of two subsets:
	- ⛓️ Chain of Thought (CoT): 860k problem-solution pairs templated with CoT to enhance mathematical reasoning in natural language
	- 🛠️ Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR): 73k synthetic solutions derived from GPT-4 with code-execution feedback to decompose hard problems into simpler subproblems that can be solved with Python
