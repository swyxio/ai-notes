- Gemini 1.5
	- 1m context supported, 10m capacity in research
	- [official blogpost](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/#gemini-15), [technical report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf), [hn](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39383446)
		- This includes making Gemini 1.5 more efficient to train and serve, with a new [Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538) (MoE) architecture.
		- The first Gemini 1.5 model we’re releasing for early testing is Gemini 1.5 Pro. It’s a mid-size multimodal model, optimized for scaling across a wide-range of tasks, and [performs at a similar level to 1.0 Ultra](https://goo.gle/GeminiV1-5), our largest model to date. It also introduces a breakthrough experimental feature in long-context understanding.
		- **Gemini 1.5 Pro comes with a standard 128,000 token context window. But starting today, a limited group of developers and enterprise customers can try it with a context window of up to 1 million tokens via [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) in private preview.**
		- Through a series of machine learning innovations, we’ve increased 1.5 Pro’s context window capacity far beyond the original 32,000 tokens for Gemini 1.0. We can now run up to 1 million tokens in production.
		- when tested on long code prompts, [HVM author agrees gemini retrieval is better than GPT4](https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1atjz9v/ive_put_a_complex_codebase_into_a_single/)

- [Deepmind Genie](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15391?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) ([tweet](https://twitter.com/_rockt/status/1762026090262872161?s=12&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww))
	- a foundation world model trained exclusively from Internet videos that can generate an endless variety of action-controllable 2D worlds given image prompts.
	- Rather than adding inductive biases, we focus on scale. We use a dataset of >200k hours of videos from 2D platformers and train an 11B world model. In an unsupervised way, Genie learns diverse latent actions that control characters in a consistent manner.
	- Genie is an action-controllable world model, but trained fully unsupervised from videos. So how do we do this?
		- We use a temporally-aware video tokenizer that compresses videos into discrete tokens, a latent action model that encodes transitions between two frames as one of 8 latent actions, and a MaskGIT dynamics model that predicts future frames.
		- No surprises here: data and compute! We trained a classifier to filter for a high quality subset of our videos and conducted scaling experiments that show model performance improves steadily with increased parameter count and batch size. Our final model has 11B parameters.
	- Google DeepMind has built Genie, a generative model that can create interactive world. The results are compelling and convincing - the Genie architecture lets DeepMind train a system on a bunch of videos of computer games and it creates a generative model that lets people feed in photos of games (or sketches of games) and then be able to play them, with the model inferring the in-game dynamics on the fly. DeepMind also does the same thing with robotics, creating a robotic model that can infer world state and control dynamics.
	- The Genie game model is an 11b parameter model trained on “a filtered set of 30,000 hours of Internet gameplay videos from hundreds of 2D platformer games”. The dataset was constructed by “filtering publicly available videos for keywords relating to platformers, yielding 55M 16s video clips at 10FPS, with 160x90 resolution. The final dataset contains 6.8M 16s video clips (30k hours)”.

	- Next to standard text-to-image generation, Stable Cascade can generate image variations and image-to-image generations. Image variations work by extracting image embeddings from a given image using CLIP and then returning this back to the model.
- [Meta V-JEPA model](https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email) - video version of I-JEPA model
	- V-JEPA is a non-generative model that learns by predicting missing or masked parts of a video in an abstract representation space. This is similar to how our [Image Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA)](https://ai.meta.com/blog/yann-lecun-ai-model-i-jepa/) compares abstract representations of images (rather than comparing the pixels themselves). Unlike generative approaches that try to fill in every missing pixel, V-JEPA has the flexibility to discard unpredictable information, which leads to improved training and sample efficiency by a factor between 1.5x and 6x.
	- Because it takes a self-supervised learning approach, V-JEPA is pre-trained entirely with unlabeled data. Labels are only used to adapt the model to a particular task after pre-training. This type of architecture proves more efficient than previous models, both in terms of the number of labeled examples needed and the total amount of effort put into learning even the unlabeled data. With V-JEPA, we’ve seen efficiency boosts on both of these fronts.
	- With V-JEPA, we mask out a large portion of a video so the model is only shown a little bit of the context. We then ask the predictor to fill in the blanks of what’s missing—not in terms of the actual pixels, but rather as a more abstract description in this representation space.

	- was a “huge endeavor” with over 3000 collaborators around the world, including teams and participants from 119 countries, said Sara Hooker, VP of research at Cohere and leader of Cohere for AI. With over 513 million instruction fine-tuned annotations
- [Stable Cascade](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39360106): a new arch vs stable diffusion
	-  Stable Diffusion uses a compression factor of 8, resulting in a 1024x1024 image being encoded to 128x128. Stable Cascade achieves a compression factor of 42, meaning that it is possible to encode a 1024x1024 image to 24x24, while maintaining crisp reconstructions. The text-conditional model is then trained in the highly compressed latent space. 
	- Previous versions of this architecture, achieved a 16x cost reduction over Stable Diffusion 1.5.
	- Stable Cascade consists of three models: Stage A, Stage B and Stage C, representing a cascade for generating images, hence the name "Stable Cascade". Stage A & B are used to compress images, similarly to what the job of the VAE is in Stable Diffusion. However, as mentioned before, with this setup a much higher compression of images can be achieved. Furthermore, Stage C is responsible for generating the small 24 x 24 latents given a text prompt. The following picture shows this visually. Note that Stage A is a VAE and both Stage B & C are diffusion models.
	- For this release, we are providing two checkpoints for Stage C, two for Stage B and one for Stage A. Stage C comes with a 1 billion and 3.6 billion parameter version, but we highly recommend using the 3.6 billion version, as most work was put into its finetuning. The two versions for Stage B amount to 700 million and 1.5 billion parameters. Both achieve great results, however the 1.5 billion excels at reconstructing small and fine details. Therefore, you will achieve the best results if you use the larger variant of each. Lastly, Stage A contains 20 million parameters and is fixed due to its small size.

	- "With proper instructions, marginalia will transform any list of texts into structured data."
	- In contrast with other json libraries and frameworks for LLM, marginalia does not rely on _controlled generation_ but on _bootstrap generation_: instead of selecting LLM output at the token level, marginalia retains or rejects an entire generation.
	- marginalia is closely integrated with vllm, and takes advantage of its generation speed. Depending on the prompt and the data constraints, a significant share of the generated annotations will not be compliant, either because they are not valid json, because they cannot be unambiguously associated to the original text or because they fail to satisfy some explicit conditions. marginalia will re-generate every non-compliant data until the output is complete.

Looking at a weekly average of hundreds of billions of files reveals that Magika improves file type identification accuracy by 50% compared to our previous system that relied on handcrafted rules. In particular, this increase in accuracy allows us to scan 11% more files with our specialized malicious AI document scanners and reduce the number of unidentified files to 3%.
	- I ran this on some web crawl data I have locally, so: all files you'd find on regular websites; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts etc. It identified some simple HTML files (html, head, title, body, p tags and not much else) as "MS Visual Basic source (VBA)", "ASP source (code)", and "Generic text document" where the `file` utility correctly identified all such examples as "HTML document text".

		- Groq’s chip has a fully deterministic VLIW architecture, with no buffers, and it reaches ~725mm2 die size on Global Foundries 14nm process node. It has no external memory, and it keeps weights, KVCache, and activations, etc all on-chip during processing. Because each chip only has 230MB of SRAM, no useful models can actually fit on a single chip. Instead, they must utilize many chips to fit the model and network them together.
		- In the case of the Mixtral model, Groq had to connect 8 racks of 9 servers each with 8 chips per server. That’s a total of 576 chips to build up the inference unit and serve the Mixtral model. Compare that to Nvidia where a single H100 can fit the model at low batch sizes, and two chips have enough memory to support large batch sizes.
		- The wafer cost used to fabricate Groq’s chip is likely less than $6,000 per wafer. Compare this to Nvidia’s H100 at 814mm2 die size on a custom variant of TSMC’s 5nm called 4N. The cost for these wafers is closer to $16,000 per wafer. On the flip side, Groq’s architecture seems less viable for implementing yield harvesting versus Nvidia’s, who has an extremely high parametric yield, due to them disabling ~15% of die for most H100 SKUs.
		- 8xA100s can serve Mixtral and achieve a throughput of ~220 tokens per second per user, and 8xH100s can hit ~280 tokens per second per user without speculative decoding. With Speculative decoding, the 8xH100 inference unit can achieve throughputs approaching 420 tokens per second per user. The throughput could exceed this figure, but implementing speculative decoding on MoE models is challenging.

	- Introducing **Long Context Data Engineering**, a data driven method achieving the first 128k context open source model matching GPT4-level Needle in a Haystack ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10171), [GitHub](https://github.com/FranxYao/Long-Context-Data-Engineering), [tweet](https://twitter.com/francis_yao_/status/1759986097365627054?s=12&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww))
		- **Our key hypothesis is that the capability of utilizing information anywhere within the 128k context is already in the base model, and can be readily “unlocked” by light weight continue pretraining. In our case we only use 5b tokens, which requires 5days training on 8xA100**
		- Our recipe is to construct the per-source length upsampled data from existing pretraining datasets. Specifically we keep the domain mixture the same as the pretraining mixture to maintain capability balance, and within each domain, upsample long data to improve long context.

		- "RAG is cheap, long context is expensive"
			- response: history of AI tells it is much easier to make smart models cheaper than making cheap model smart -- when it is cheap, it's never smart.
		- "Long context can mix retrieval and reasoning during the whole decoding processing"
			- response: RAG only does the retrieval at the very beginning. Typically, given a question, RAG retrieves the paragraphs that is related to the question, then generate. Long-context does the retrieval for every layer and every token.
		- "RAG supports trillion level tokens, long-context is 1M."
			- response: True, but there is a natural distribution of the input document, and I tend to believe most of the cases that requires retrieval is under million level
		- "RAG can be cached, long-context needs to re-enter the whole document."
			- This is a common misunderstanding of long-context: you only read the input once, then all subsequent queries will reuse the kv cache. One may argue that kv cache is large -- true, but don't worry, we LLM researchers will give you crazy kv cache compression algorithms just in time.

			- [problem with cosine similarity](https://twitter.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1759825786008109092?s=12&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww)
				-  "Many practical vector databases and neural search solutions depend on fast cosine similarity matching between document and query embeddings. While appealing for its straightforwardness and computational efficiency, this method, often referred to as "no interaction" or "not interaction-based" has been found to underperform in comparison to models that incorporate some form of interaction between queries and documents.
				- Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT (ColBERT), implements late interaction, which allows for efficient and precise retrieval by processing queries and documents separately until the final stages of the retrieval process.
	- attention is quadratic in context length, but NOT transformers compute
		- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39461568
		- because [the FFN is a big part of the compute](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1658161721251602432?s=20)
		- and [flashattention isnt quadratic with sequence length](https://x.com/BlancheMinerva/status/1760026749390176662?s=20) when you look at TFLOPS/s
			- mathematically it scales quadratically, but in practice, current GPU hardware is utilised more efficiently when the sequences are longer, and this means in practice wall clock compute time scales more favourably than quadratic
		- see also [delip rao and stella biderman](https://x.com/BlancheMinerva/status/1760020927188697160?s=20)
		- For example, to take a concrete model (say Llama-70B), it takes about 1.4e16 MLP FLOPs (70 billion * 100000 * 2) to process 100k tokens. The attention component takes about 6.5e15 FLOPS (80 [layers] * 100k [sequence length]^2 * 8192 [hidden dim]). So even if attention turned constant it would reduce runtime by about 30% with today's model at 100k sequence length.
		- To anyone doubting this, note that llama.cpp does not slow down by a factor of 16 when you pass -c 2048 instead of -c 512.

		- [tweet](https://twitter.com/burkov/status/1761566687239815393?s=12&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww) The model size of 7B parameters and the full attention of 4k tokens aren't often coming together by coincidence. This is a maximum you can physically train on a standard 8xA100 or 8xH100 Nvidia GPU node with Flash Attention 2 and model sharding. 
		- The model is split into pieces. Each piece is put on one of the 8 GPUs. Together with the gradients and the attention matrix, they fill the 80GB of a GPU entirely.
		- If you see a model with more than 4k token context, it is cheating somehow, for example by using Multi-Query Attention like in Gemma or Sliding Window Attention like in Mistral. If you see a finetune of a 30B+ parameters made on one 8xA/H100 machine, it's a QLoRA, most likely quantized to 8 or 4 bits.
