code improves reasoning
- starcoder has reasoning abilities https://twitter.com/LoubnaBenAllal1/status/1655932410566168577
- replit too (amasad tweet only source so far)
- yao fu is exploring this actively https://twitter.com/Francis_YAO_/status/1657985409706762241
- [Large Language Models trained on code reason better, even on benchmarks that have nothing to do with code. Some good discussion here about the topic:](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/13gk5da/r_large_language_models_trained_on_code_reason/)

ccording to the post, Claude 2 now 71.2%, a significant upgrade from 1.3 (56.0%). (Found in model card: pass@1)

For comparison:

* GPT-4 claims 85.4 on HumanEval, in a recent paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366.pdf) GPT-4 was tested at 80.1 pass@1 and 91 pass@1 using their Reflexion technique. They also include MBPP and Leetcode Hard benchmark comparisons

* WizardCoder, a StarCoder fine-tune is one of the top open models, scoring a 57.3 pass@1, model card here: [https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-15B-V1.0](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-15B-V1.0)

* The best open model I know of atm is replit-code-instruct-glaive, a replit-code-3b fine tune, which scores a 63.5% pass@1. An independent developer abacaj has reproduced that announcement as part of code-eval, a repo for getting human-eval results: [https://github.com/abacaj/code-eval](https://github.com/abacaj/code-eval)

Those interested in this area may also want to take a look at this repo [https://github.com/my-other-github-account/llm-humaneval-ben...](https://github.com/my-other-github-account/llm-humaneval-benchmarks) that also ranks with Eval+, the CanAiCode Leaderboard [https://huggingface.co/spaces/mike-ravkine/can-ai-code-resul...](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mike-ravkine/can-ai-code-results) and airate [https://github.com/catid/supercharger/tree/main/airate](https://github.com/catid/supercharger/tree/main/airate)

At inference, it generates a million possible solutions and filters out the bad ones. In this way, it retroactively beat more than half of contestants in 10 coding competitions.

Additionally, GitHub has updated the client of Copilot to reduce unwanted suggestions by 4.5% for improved overall code acceptance rates. "When we first launched GitHub Copilot for Individuals in June 2022, more than 27% of developers’ code files on average were generated by GitHub Copilot," Senior Director of Product Management Shuyin Zhao said.

"Today, GitHub Copilot is behind an average of 46% of a developers’ code across all programming languages—and in Java, that number jumps to 61%."

## benchmarks

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06689.pdf
MBPP [Austin et al., 2021] This benchmark, referred to as "Mostly Basic Programming Problems", contains nearly 1000 crowd-sourced python programming problems, covering programming fundamentals, standard library functionality, and more. Each problem in the benchmark consists of a NL description, a code solution, and 3 automated test cases. A portion of the manually verified data is extracted as "MBPP-sanitized". For MBPP, which does not include function signatures, only the NL description is provided as input. 

HumanEval [Chen et al., 2021] This benchmark is a set of 164 handwritten programming problems, proposed by OpenAI. Each problem includes a function signature, NL description, function body, and several unit tests, with an average of 7.7 tests per problem. For HumanEval, function signature, NL description, and public test cases are provided as input. Furthermore, we utilize an expanded version of MBPP and HumanEval , which includes over 100 additional test cases per task, to reinforce the validity of code evaluation [Dong et al., 2023]. This extended version is referred to as MBPP-ET and HumanEval-ET.

EVA DB accelerates AI pipelines by 10-100x using a collection of performance optimizations inspired by time-tested SQL database systems, including data-parallel query execution, function caching, sampling, and cost-based predicate reordering. EVA supports an AI-oriented SQL-like query language tailored for analyzing both structured and unstructured data. It has first-class support for PyTorch, Hugging Face, YOLO, and Open AI models.

	- CodeComplete offers an experience similar to Copilot; we serve AI code completions as developers type in their IDEs. However, instead of sending private code snippets to GitHub or OpenAI, we use a self-hosted LLM to serve code completions. Another advantage with self-hosting is that it’s more straightforward to securely fine-tune to the company’s codebase. Copilot suggestions aren’t always tailored to a company’s coding patterns or internal libraries, so this can help make our completions more relevant and avoid adding tech debt.
