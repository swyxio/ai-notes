## confidential computing foundation

- board
	- minutes, money, membership
	- not about growth - about having the people and money to people who do the work
	- try to build neutral, transparent space
	- "there is no community except for the one you build"
- philosophy
	- governing board
		- sets strategic priorities
		- more a "blessing" than "directive" role - eg give blessing to OSS projects joining
	- TAC strength
		- much of the focus of the CCC resides in the TAC
		- to the possible detriment of outreach
- challenges -> mitigations
	- smaller members "swamped" -> minimal GB votes, TAC voting
	- timezone/events mismatch in rest of world -> direclty involve asiapac
	- balancing technical/outreach events -> member consultation
	- end user advisory council lack of interest
	- volunteering for nontechnical activities
	- lack of inter-project cohesion
	- the N+1th member, the LF! -> be firm in LF engagement
		- say no to the LFj
