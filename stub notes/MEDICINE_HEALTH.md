	- Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge, Google/DeepMind
	- we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams, research, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset of medical questions searched online
	- Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve this we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians.

	- To address this issue, we collected more than 700 diseases and their corresponding symptoms, required medical tests, and recommended medications, from which we generated 5K doctor-patient conversations. By fine-tuning LLMs using these tailored doctor-patient conversations, the resulting models emerge with great potential to understand patients' needs, provide informed advice, and offer valuable assistance in a variety of medical-related fields.
